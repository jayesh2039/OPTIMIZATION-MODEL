# Optimization Task

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an optimization problem using **linear programming** with **Python** libraries like **PuLP**.

### Objective:
- Maximize profit while satisfying production constraints.
- Includes multiple objectives and parametric optimization.

### Requirements:

To run the optimization notebook, you will need the following libraries:

1. **PuLP**: A Python library for linear programming.
2. **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
3. **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations and handling large datasets.

### Installation Instructions:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimization-task.git
# 2. Install the required libraries:
  - bash
  - Copy
  - Edit
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Or you can install them individually:
  - bash
  - Copy
  - Edit
  - pip install pulp matplotlib numpy
# 3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
  - bash
  - Copy
  - Edit
  - jupyter notebook
  - Running the Notebook:
  - Open the Jupyter notebook file (optimization_task.ipynb).

## Execute the cells step-by-step to see the problem setup, solution, and insights.

# Insights:
  - Linear Programming: We used PuLP for maximizing profit with constraints.
  - Sensitivity Analysis: The effect of varying labor and machine hours on profit.
  - Multiple Objectives: Profit vs cost analysis.
  - Integer Programming: Solution when product quantities are required to be integers.
